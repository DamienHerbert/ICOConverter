# ICOConverter
Convert image files to windows icon files (.ico)

Running the program currently creates an ico file from any png or jpg files in the same directory as the executable. It then outputs the files to a newly created output directory located in the same directory as the executable. 

Note: The program currently checks if the output file already exists. If the file dose exist it will do nothing and if it does not exist it will create a new ico file.
